Part 1 - Java Programming

1. 'JVM' means Java Virtual Machine. It is a runtime environment that allows us to run Java programs by
	converting the Java bytecode(.class files) of the program into machine language. Additionally, it is responsible for
	reclaiming and reusing Java memory through its Garbage collection.
	
2. A pointer is a variable that stores a memory address. It isn't the value that is stored in a memory address but rather
	a variable that points to it.
	Java does not support pointers in the way C or C++ does. It does not allow you to access or modify pointers directly.
	However, Java uses pointers implicitly as a way to manipulate references.
	
3. The constructor of a class is called when a new object of that class is created.
	A method is a piece of code implemented inside a class. It can only be called from an object that is already created.
